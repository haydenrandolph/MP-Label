						<p style="font-size:1.75vh;color:#5c4f36;">
The planning phase of any business venture is key to the success of any product. Each piece of the puzzle including formula, packaging, branding, marketing, and distribution are vital parts of a successful product. From packaging to target demographics, our experts are here to assist you each step of the way. Itâ€™s important to consider a few questions. What makes your product different from your competitors? Will your product lines have a common thread? Who is your target customer? These questions will help guide what ingredients to use, packaging, label, fragrances, Design and more.Once you are ready to begin the process, we will have you fill out an MPL New Product Evaluation Form. MPL will use this profile to get to know more about you and your brand. We will also have you fill out a New Product Formulation Request form for each product you want to make. This detailed questionnaire covers all aspects of your formula from color and fragrance to viscosity, performance, and budget. The more detailed the answers are, the faster the formulation process moves forward.						</p>

						<p style="font-size:1.75vh;color:#5c4f36;">
							With your New Product formulation Request in hand, our Research & Development team begins the process of building your product for you. If you have an existing formula, we will begin creating a pre-production sample for you to try.
							Using the latest in cosmetic chemistry innovation, our chemists create a formula that reflects the information in the New Product formulation Request provided. A bench sample within your budget is created and given to you to test. After reviewing the first sample, we ask for feedback and begin to adjust the formula based off your comments.
							Once you have approved the formula, we will begin the Stability and Compatibility Testing. This 3 month period will test the stability of the formula and compatibility with your packaging. Samples of finalized packaging are required for the test to be precise. If you wish to bypass Stability and Compatibility Testing, we require you to sign a waiver but will continue to run testing concurrently with your first production run.						</p>

						<p style="font-size:1.75vh;color:#5c4f36;">
Tubes are more popular than ever as they have many advantages in terms of convenience and sanitation. In the past, tubes were prohibitive to many companies as minimums were in the 10,000 to 25,000 range and lead times were very high. Recently, we have found a wonderful tube manufacturer with a 5,000 minimum and excellent decoration capacity. Please inquire about our new tube filling capabilities.			</div>

						<p style="font-size:1.75vh;color:#5c4f36;">
							One of the major investments of introducing a new product for test marketing purposes is obtaining a label. Traditional label printing companies usually have minimums of around 10,000 labels.
